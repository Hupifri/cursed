# Context
I saw the above meme in a music-discussion group a few days before christmas. I made the below meme as a response (with caption "engineers be like").
The next day, I was feeling bored so I decided to make a python program that plays the tune (However, the program at its current state plays the piece in A major instead of D major seen in the meme).
